# Web Scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for data extraction, cleaning, and text analysis using Python. The aim is to collect textual data from websites, process it, and extract meaningful insights using Natural Language Processing techniques.

# Key Features

# 1. Data Extraction
      Used requests to send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML content
      Parsed HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract relevant text from target web pages

# 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
      Removed HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation
      Converted all text to lowercase
      Removed stopwords using NLTK’s stopword list
      Applied tokenization and lemmatization to normalize words

# 3. Feature Extraction
      Implemented Bag-of-Words and TF–IDF vectorization using scikit-learn
      Generated document-term matrices for further analysis

# 4. Text Analysis & Topic Modeling
      Performed word frequency analysis to find the most common terms
      Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover underlying topics and themes in the 
      data

# Tech Stack
     Python (3.x)
     Libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

# Learning Outcomes
     Automated data collection from web sources
     Applied text preprocessing best practices
     Used statistical NLP techniques to transform text into numerical features
     Built an interpretable topic model to summarize large text datasets
